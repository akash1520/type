Here's a **README** that explains how to use and understand the Typing Speed Test application:

# Typing Speed Test

A simple web-based typing speed test that measures your typing accuracy and speed in words per minute (WPM). It generates random words, tracks your keystrokes, and provides statistics including time taken, accuracy, and typing speed when the test is completed.

---

## Features

- **Random Word Generator**: The test displays random words to type, making the test more dynamic each time.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The test provides visual feedback on your typing with color-coded characters (green for correct, red for errors, and yellow for the current character to type).
- **Typing Speed (WPM)**: After completion, the application calculates your **Words Per Minute (WPM)** based on how fast you typed.
- **Accuracy**: It also shows your typing accuracy, calculated based on your first-attempt correctness.
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: Supports all standard letter keys, space, comma, and period, while ignoring invalid keys like numbers or special characters.
- **Reset Option**: You can restart the test by pressing the **Tab** key.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Test**: Open the webpage. The test will automatically load random words to type.
2. **Type the Text**: As you type the words on the screen, they will change color to indicate whether they are correct or incorrect:
   - **Green**: Correctly typed.
   - **Red**: Incorrectly typed.
   - **Yellow**: Current character to type.
3. **Backspace Handling**: If you make a mistake and press backspace, it will undo the last correct/incorrect character and reset all subsequent characters.
4. **Test Completion**: Once you type all the words correctly or reach the end of the text, the following statistics will appear:
   - **Time Taken**: The duration it took to complete the test in seconds.
   - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct keystrokes based on first attempts.
   - **Words per Minute (WPM)**: The estimated typing speed in words per minute.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the page structure.
- **CSS**: For styling the page.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the typing logic, timing, and calculation of typing speed.
